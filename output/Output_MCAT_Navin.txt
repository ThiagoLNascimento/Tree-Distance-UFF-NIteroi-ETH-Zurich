Sum of the distance between the consensus and all input: 235
Closest = 15.0
Median = 104.31578947368422
Normalized gap (closest) = 1.0
Normalized gap (median) = 0.6018827816580625
Closest = max / (max input / 2) = 30 / (30 / 2) = 2
Median = Sum / (sum_input / 19 ) = 235 / (2483 / 19) = 1.79
Sum of distance between all input = 2483
